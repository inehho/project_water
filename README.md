Thurs team updates - Tom
Changes: 

Renamed column headers in WHO data before merge to make resulting DF less confusing. 
Merged dataframes on year and country to eliminate years for which there was no water data (see Issues)
Used .loc to filter out each country 
Started simple plots for each country (just cholera cases by year) 

ISSUES: It looks like some data got lost in the merge – need to review. (May be some mismatch between cholera data water data – we can look more closely at what got lost in the merge)

To do: 
Figure out data merge issue
Plan subplots
